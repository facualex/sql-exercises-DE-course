# Setup

First we need to install **miniconda**. You can follow the instructions in the official conda documentation: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Once you have **miniconda** installed in your system, run the following command on your terminal to create a virtual enviroment to work on (make sure you are in the same directory as this project):

````
conda env create --file enviroment.yaml
````

Then, to activate the virtual enviroment, run:

````
conda activate sql-exercises-DE-course
````

Lunch Jupyter Notebook running the following command on your terminal:

````
jupyter notebook
````

This will open a Web Based Jupyter Notebook instance. In the Web UI you can open the notebooks provided in this directory.
